## How RS Office Recovery Works
 
RS Office Recovery uses a combination of advanced algorithms and content-aware analysis to locate and recover office documents from any storage device. It can scan the entire disk surface or a specific partition, looking for traces of deleted or overwritten files. It can also analyze the file system structure and metadata, recovering files with their original names and paths.
 
RS Office Recovery can also deal with complex situations, such as corrupted or reformatted partitions, damaged or unreadable disks, or encrypted or password-protected files. It can bypass the Windows access restrictions and access the device in low level, using its own drivers and methods. It can also create and process virtual disk images, which are exact copies of the original physical devices stored in a file on another disk.
 
RS Office Recovery supports all types of office documents, including text documents, spreadsheets, presentations, databases, PDF files and more. It can recover documents created with all versions of Microsoft Office, from Office 95 to Office 2019. It can also recover documents created with OpenOffice, LibreOffice, StarOffice and other compatible applications.
